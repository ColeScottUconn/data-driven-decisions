    "The Cosine Similarity score was 33.6% suggesting that this document is mine with the included edits. Using this score it can be concluded that the text is measurably different from the original ChatGPT output. While ChatGPT did include some important ideas such as brushing at a 45% angle, I would say I included more significant ideas such as brushing gently, being sure to include the gums, and ensuring it took 2 minutes. I would argue that the text I created is a new document, as the original document still exists uneditted. I believe that if I had revised and added to another persons text (in place of the ChatGPT text) I would need to cite them as a reference. However, because they did not work with me, and I built upon their ideas I dont think I would credit them as a co-author. While the person provided me with initial knowledge, they had no control over my ideas and ultimatelty the outcome of my work. Therefore, they could not consent to my ideas or to being credited as an author."
