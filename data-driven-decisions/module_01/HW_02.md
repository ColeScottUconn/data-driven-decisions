## Calculating and reporting $\pi$

Calculate your own value of $\pi$ using the random x- and y-coordinates. You need to report your findings to other engineers in your field. You should explain _why_ and _how_ you are calculating $\pi$, then describe the data with at least one plot. You can use more if it helps to explain the process or a point you are trying to make, here are some examples from our first $\pi$ calculation. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
rng = default_rng(42)
plt.figure()

ax1 = plt.subplot(2, 2, (1, 2))
for N in range(100,1001, 100):
    trials = 100
    pi_trial = np.zeros(trials)
    for i in range(trials):
        x = rng.random(N)
        y = rng.random(N)

        r = x**2 + y**2

        pi_trial[i] = np.sum(r < 1**2)/N*4

    mean_pi = np.mean(pi_trial)
    std_pi = np.std(pi_trial)

    ax1.plot(N*np.ones(trials), pi_trial, 'ko', alpha = 0.1)
plt.title(r'Value of $\pi=${:1.3f}$\pm${:1.3f}'.format(mean_pi, std_pi));
ax2 = plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
ax2.hist(pi_trial, 20, density=True)


x = np.linspace(3, 3.3)
pi_pdf = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc = mean_pi, scale = std_pi)
ax2.plot(x, pi_pdf)

ax3 = plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
ax3.boxplot(pi_trial, vert=False);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ax1 = plt.subplot(1, 1, 1)
for N in range(100,1001, 100):
    trials = 100
    pi_trial = np.zeros(trials)
    for i in range(trials):
        x = rng.random(N)
        y = rng.random(N)

        r = x**2 + y**2

        pi_trial[i] = np.sum(r < 1**2)/N*4

    mean_pi = np.mean(pi_trial)
    std_pi = np.std(pi_trial)
    plt.plot(N*np.ones(trials), pi_trial, 'ko', alpha = 0.1)
```

## Some points to consider in your report

- $\pi$ is not a random variable, but the probability that you land in a circle vs a square if your coordinates are x = 0-r and y = 0-r is $\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \frac{\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \frac{\pi}{4}$.
- When is the mean "close enough" to $\pi$?
- What do the tails of the calculated $\pi$ values tell us about the prediction?
- What else do you notice in your analysis?
